**Problem Statement** \
We are trying to predict the Sales as per store id. This is a pure regression problem.


**Context**
1. XYZ operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 countries. XYZ store managers are currently tasked with predicting their daily sales. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school, and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. 
2. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.


**About Datasets**
1. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 XYZ stores. The task is to predict the "Sales" for the test set. 
2. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.
3. We have two datasets. \
   Sales data - Columns - 9,  Rows - 1017210 \
   Stores data - Columns - 10, Rows - 1115

Using machine learning techniques, I've developed a model to predict retail sales using Sales and Stores data. Based on different parameters, stores can take necessary steps to enhance/boost
their sales.
